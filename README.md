**Iceberg Lab**

# Summary
This workshop will take you through the new capabilities that have been added to CDP PvC Base Lakehouse Edition version 7.1.9.
In this workshop you will learn how to take advantage of Iceberg to support ata Lakehouse initiatives.
These instructions include: 1) setup of the Workshop; and 2) Labs that you will execute as part of the Workshop.
Value Propositions: Take advantage of Iceberg - CDP’s Open Data Lakehouse, to experience:
- Better performance
- Lower maintenance responsibilities
- Multi-function analytics without having many copies of data
- Greater control.

*Note to admins: Refer to the Setup file containing the recommendations to setup the lab*

The following labs will take you through various CDP 7.1.9 PvC Base Services to enable you on what will be available to support Data Lakehouse use cases.  CDP 7.1.9 PvC Base now includes support for Apache Iceberg in the following services: Impala, Flink, SSB, Spark 3, NiFi, and Replication (BDR).   This makes Cloudera the only vendor to support Iceberg in a multi-hybrid cloud environment.  Users can develop an Iceberg application once and deploy anywhere.

# 1. Introduction to Iceberg with NiFi and Sql Stream Builder

NiFi/Flink/SSB (Ingest Data ,Stream Data, SQL Stream Builder Queries)
In this lab we are going to use Nifi, Flink, and Sql Stream Builder to complete sample integrations with Iceberg.  First we will use NiFi to ingest an airport route data set (JSON) and send that data to Kafka and Iceberg. Next we will use NiFi to ingest a countries data set (JSON) and send to Kafka and Iceberg.  Finally we will use NiFi to ingest an airports data set (JSON) and send to Kafka and Iceberg.  Once we are complete with NiFi we will shift into Sql Streams Builder to show its capability to query Kafka with SQL, Infer Schema, Create Iceberg Connectors,  and use SQL to INSERT INTO an Iceberg Table.  Finally we will wrap up by jumping back into Hue and taking a look at the tables we created.
