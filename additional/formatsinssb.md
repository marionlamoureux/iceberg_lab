When you select Data Format as AVRO, you must provide the correct Schema Definition when creating the table for SSB to be able to successfully process the topic data. For JSON tables, though, SSB can look at the data flowing through the topic and try to infer the schema automatically, which is quite handy at times. Obviously, there must be data in the topic already for this feature to work correctly.

Note: SSB tries its best to infer the schema correctly, but this is not always possible and sometimes data types are inferred incorrectly. You should always review the inferred schemas to check if itâ€™s correctly inferred and make the necessary adjustments.
