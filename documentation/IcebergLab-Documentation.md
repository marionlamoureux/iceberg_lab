# Data Set
Schema for the data set is below: Entity-Relation Diagram of tables we use in todays workshop:

Fact table: flights (86mio rows)
Dimension tables: airlines (1.5k rows), airports (3.3k rows), planes (5k rows) and unique tickets (100k rows).

# PySpark

For reference only, and because Iceberg will integrate nicely with all the components of the Cloudera Data Platform 
and with different engines, the task can be performed in PySpark, looking like so:  

**In pyspark**  
  
```SQL
SELECT partition,file_path, file_size_in_bytes
FROM ${user_id}_airlines_maint.flights.files order by partition

```
# ACID

ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: 
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. If a database operation has these ACID properties, 
it can be called an ACID transaction, and data storage systems that apply these operations are called transactional systems.
This set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

In the context of Iceberg specifically, additional information can be found in this [blog article](https://blog.min.io/iceberg-acid-transactions/)


# SSB environment
 Creating an environment file for a project means that users can create a template with variables that could be used to
store environment-specific configuration.
For example, you might have a development, staging and production environment, each containing different clusters,
databases, service URLs and authentication methods. Projects and environments allow you to write the logic and create the resources once, and use template placeholders for values that need to be replaced with the environment
specific parameters.
To each project, you can create multiple environments, but only one can be active at a time for a project.
Environments can be exported to files, and can be imported again to be used for another project, or on another cluster.
While environments are applied to a given project, they are not part of the project. They are not synchronized to Git
when exporting or importing the project. This separation is what allows the storing of environment-specific values, or
configurations that you do not want to expose to the Git repository.


# Schemas in SSB


When you select Data Format as AVRO, you must provide the correct Schema Definition when creating the table for SSB to be able to successfully process the topic data. For JSON tables, though, SSB can look at the data flowing through the topic and try to infer the schema automatically, which is quite handy at times. Obviously, there must be data in the topic already for this feature to work correctly.

Note: SSB tries its best to infer the schema correctly, but this is not always possible and sometimes data types are inferred incorrectly. You should always review the inferred schemas to check if itâ€™s correctly inferred and make the necessary adjustments.
